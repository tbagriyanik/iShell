# iShell Desktop Simulator

A web-based desktop environment simulator built with React, Tailwind CSS, and the Gemini API.

## Features

*   Customizable desktop (theme, background, font, icon size)
*   Draggable and resizable windows
*   Context menus with light/dark theme awareness
*   AI-powered app generation (requires Gemini API Key)
*   Taskbar with app search, dynamic open window tabs, and clock
*   Settings persistence in LocalStorage
*   Import/Export settings and apps
*   Basic example applications generated by AI from simple prompts
*   Multilingual support (English, Turkish)

## Running the Application Locally

This application is designed to run directly in a modern web browser without needing a dedicated web server or complex build steps.

1.  **Download the Files:**
    *   Ensure you have all the project files:
        *   `index.html`
        *   `index.tsx`
        *   `App.tsx`
        *   `types.ts`
        *   `constants.tsx`
        *   All files in the `components` directory (e.g., `TopBar.tsx`, `Desktop.tsx`, `Window.tsx`, `ContextMenu.tsx`, `SettingsWindowContent.tsx`, etc.)
        *   `metadata.json`
        *   `README.md` (this file)

2.  **API Key (Optional, for AI features):**
    *   The application uses the Gemini API for generating application content (including the example apps). To use these features, you need a Gemini API Key.
    *   You can obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    *   When you first run the application, or if no API key is set, you will be prompted to enter it. You can also set or change it later in the "Settings" app (accessible via the three-dot icon in the taskbar or the "Settings" app icon on the desktop).
    *   **Important:** The API key is stored in your browser's LocalStorage and is *not* transmitted anywhere else by this application other than directly to the Google Gemini API endpoints.

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Locate the `index.html` file in your downloaded project folder.
    *   Open this `index.html` file directly with your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). You can usually do this by double-clicking the file or right-clicking and choosing "Open with...".

4.  **Usage:**
    *   The desktop interface will load.
    *   If you haven't provided a Gemini API key, AI-powered app generation features will be disabled. Example apps will show simplified placeholder content. If an API key is provided, the example apps will be generated by the AI.
    *   Right-click on the desktop or app icons for context menus.
    *   Open the "Settings" app to customize the appearance (theme, background, font, icons), system settings (API key, language), and manage backups.

## Development Notes

*   The application uses `ES6` modules and an `importmap` in `index.html` to load React and other dependencies (like `@google/genai`) directly from CDNs (esm.sh).
*   Tailwind CSS is included via a CDN script and configured directly in `index.html`.
*   All custom TypeScript/TSX code is processed by the browser's native module loader. No separate build step (like Webpack or Parcel) is required for basic execution.
*   The application state (settings, user-created apps, window positions) is persisted in the browser's LocalStorage.
*   Error handling for API calls and unexpected responses is implemented to provide a more robust user experience.
*   The UI aims for responsiveness and accessibility, using ARIA attributes where appropriate.
